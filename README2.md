I am making my 2D array a 1D array to pass the zybooks test

###Step 1
I am changing all of the constructors to match the 1D array syntax of (row x col)

###Step 2
I made the constructor(file) work. I changed the array type. It does not pass the test yet because the .tostring method needs to be change

###Step 3
Get all the easy return statements to match the required syntax

###Step 4
Figure out how in the world the project row and col works with 1D arrays. Turns out it is kinda complicated

###step 5
The to String method needed to be fixed for syntax issues

###step 6
Then to figure out the save method. I have some edge case bugs I cannot figure
out
